The project for the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Culture aims to develop a LinkedIn-like platform that serves as a unified and fast platform for Saudi creative individuals. The platform allows users to showcase their work, connect with employers, and apply for job opportunities. Additionally, users can share content and announcements with their followers and connections.

## Description

The architecture of the project incorporates several patterns and technologies to achieve its goals:

###### Microservices Architecture
The system adopts a microservices architecture, breaking down the application into smaller, loosely coupled services. Each microservice focuses on specific functionalities, enabling independent development, deployment, and scalability.

###### Database per Service Pattern
The database per service pattern is implemented, where each microservice has its dedicated database. This approach enhances loose coupling, independent data management, and scalability.

###### Domain Event Pattern
The domain event pattern is utilized to enable asynchronous communication and decoupling between services. It allows for real-time updates and consistency across microservices by propagating domain events when specific actions or events occur.

###### Gateway Offloading Pattern
The gateway offloading pattern is employed, where a central gateway service handles incoming requests and offloads tasks such as authentication, authorization, and routing to dedicated microservices. This enhances performance and scalability by reducing the load on individual microservices.

###### Twitter Architecture for Feed Microservices
The feed microservices follow an architecture inspired by Twitter. Techniques such as sharding, caching, and event-driven updates are employed to create a scalable and real-time feed generation system. This ensures efficient delivery of personalized feeds to users.

## Summary

The LinkedIn-like platform for the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Culture utilizes a microservices architecture with specific patterns such as database per service, domain event, gateway offloading, and a Twitter-inspired feed microservices architecture. This approach provides a fast and unified platform for Saudi creative individuals, enabling them to showcase their work, connect with employers, and apply for job opportunities. By incorporating modern architectural patterns, the platform ensures scalability, performance, and flexibility, supporting the needs of the creative community in Saudi Arabia.
