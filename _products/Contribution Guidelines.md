Actually, we're not really restrictive, but for the sake of consistency we would love to see some simple rules followed when you publish something via this site ;)

## When you offer an example application, then please make sure that your code is runnable on Gitpod.
This way someone who wants to try out what you were doing can start in an instant instead of trying to figure out what setup exactly you did use.
The benefit on your side would be that you can just skip the usual setup tutorial steps, as the running coding environment is already set up and also in a reproducable way.

## When you are creating diagrams then we would love to see them made via draw.io.
On the one hand it is a great open source tool that deserves to be supported, on the other hand they have a great GitHub integration.
This way you can create diagrams that can be altered in the future (maybe your post needs some updates) and this can be done by everyone without installing any tools.
Just save your diagrams as they are in the according images folder next to the exported .png version of your image (both should have the same name, aside from the .png part)

---

## Please be objective with regard to other technologies and frameworks.
People that come to this site shall learn something about OSGi and why we think it is the best thing on earth, but NOT to read about opinions on other frameworks/technologies.
It's up to the reader to judge for himself ;)

## Please keep things as simple as you can.
Often people that are deeply involved in a technology forget about how little they knew when they started their journey. 
Very often those people take context knowledge as granted although without this knowledge all they do looks like complete magic to others.
So when you write a post, an example or an explanation, then take a step back afterwards and ask yourself if your past self would have understood what you have written down without all the knowledge you gained over time ;)
(This usually is the most difficult part of writing texts and I myself often violate this rule ;) so just give your best) 

That all said: Please join us! Whether its a typo, a short blog post, an example on how to use a library or anything else, we will welcome everyone willing to contribute to this site :)
